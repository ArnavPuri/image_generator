An experiment to generate images using #ReactJS and #Puppeteer.

## Motivation:
I have an App on [Google Play Store, Bhagwad Gita](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brownfingers.bhagwatgitaapp&ref=github) and I want to generate marketing images for it.


Steps I am following to achieve this:
- Create ReactJS (front end)
    - Create background component which takes in image prop and acts as a container of size 800 by 800 px
    - Grab a nice abstract image url from Unsplash
    - Add Title and Subtitle with proper css

- add Puppeteer to project and a separate directory 'functions' to write screenshot capture script
-
